# JChess
This project aims to implement a Java CLI based application to allow people to play the classic game of chess. The game will provide the option to both play in a hotseat (local) play setting, along with a networked version to allow play to happen remotely.

## Development Phases
1. Interface and General Functionality (in progress)
2. Hotseat Functionality and Testing (not started)
3. Networking Functionality (not started)
4. (Optional) Encryption/Security for Network Functionality, Chess Notation Output to Text File, Time Limits (not started)

Currently, this program can only work as expected on Windows systems due to a call to cmd.exe. I intend to look into a better approach for this to allow the game to be cross-platform.
